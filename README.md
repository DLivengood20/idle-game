# Cookie Clicker Clone

This project is meant to mimic the game "Cookie Clicker" using openai chat to assist.

## Project Purpose

This project is being used as a learning experience for react.js and basic game design in web development.

## Description

This project creates a web application in which the user can play an idle game.

The game starts with a clickable cookie that increases the cookie count by 1/click. The user can then use stored cookies to purchase auto-clickers, items that increase the cookie count automatically. Auto-clickers come in tiers to provide cookie count goals.

Future plans:  
- More auto-clicker types
- User click upgrades
- Prestige rewards
- Graphical assets and effects
- Sound effects
